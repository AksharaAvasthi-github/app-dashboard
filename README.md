## 🌟 Overview
The **Predictive Delivery Optimizer** is a data-driven logistics intelligence tool developed for **NexGen Logistics Pvt. Ltd.**  
It uses machine learning and analytics to **predict delivery delays**, **assign optimal vehicles**, and **minimize CO2 emissions** — all visualized through a sleek, dark-themed **Streamlit dashboard**.

Built as part of the **NexGen Logistics Innovation Challenge**, this project demonstrates real-world **innovation**, **problem-solving**, and **data-driven decision-making**.

---

## 🎯 Objective
Help NexGen Logistics transform from **reactive** to **predictive** operations by:
- Predicting delays **before they occur**
- Matching the **right vehicle** to the **right delivery**
- Reducing **fuel cost** and **carbon emissions**
- Improving **on-time performance** and **customer satisfaction**

---

## 🧠 Key Features
✅ **Predictive Delay Modeling** – Machine Learning (Random Forest) predicts potential delivery delays.  
✅ **Fleet Optimization** – Dynamically assigns vehicles based on weight, CO2, and cost factors.  
✅ **Sustainability Insights** – Tracks CO2 emissions and environmental impact.  
✅ **Interactive Dashboards** – Visual analytics using Plotly and Streamlit.  
✅ **Performance KPIs** – Live metrics on delivery efficiency, CO2, and cost.  
✅ **One-Click Export** – Download optimized results in CSV format.
